# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler 

## Matthieu Burguburu

## Chau Ying Kot

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.
