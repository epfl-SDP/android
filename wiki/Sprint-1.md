# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler 
For the first week the workload was straightforward and not very demanding. This was exactly what I needed to familiarize myself with the technologies. It also supported a smooth start in a certain project management flow, which requires time to embrace itself at the beginning of a project. I didn't had a lot of problems this weeks except the fact that I had to attend the meetings remotely because of a positive corona test.

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.
