Since it was my first time working with Jetpack Compose, I had to take an online codelab. I also received huge help from Alexandre which was nice. However, it took me quite sometime to refactor the code, at least more than I have expected. I have also learnt some Kotlin Coroutines and Flows and Flow from the dearest Scrum Master himself by reviewing some of his PRs.
