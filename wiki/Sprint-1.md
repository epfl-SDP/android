# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler 

## Matthieu Burguburu

During this sprint, I added Firebase support to the app and modeled the user profile api. I had no real trouble adding Firebase support, but the testing of the user profile api was more challenging than expected, since mocking Firebase was really impractical. After changes made by Alexandre, mocking was really made more practical and I had no more trouble finishing my task.

## Chau Ying Kot

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.
