# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler 
For the first week the workload was straightforward and not very demanding. This was exactly what I needed to familiarize myself with the technologies. It also supported a smooth start in a certain project management flow, which requires time to embrace itself at the beginning of a project. I didn't had a lot of problems this weeks except the fact that I had to attend the meetings remotely because of a positive corona test.

During this sprint, I added Firebase support to the app and modeled the user profile api. I had no real trouble adding Firebase support, but the testing of the user profile api was more challenging than expected, since mocking Firebase was really impractical. After changes made by Alexandre, mocking was really made more practical and I had no more trouble finishing my task.

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.
