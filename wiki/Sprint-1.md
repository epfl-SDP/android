# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler 
For the first week the workload was straightforward and not very demanding. This was exactly what I needed to familiarize myself with the technologies. It also supported a smooth start in a certain project management flow, which requires time to embrace itself at the beginning of a project. I didn't had a lot of problems this weeks except the fact that I had to attend the meetings remotely because of a positive corona test. 
## Matthieu Burguburu

During this sprint, I added Firebase support to the app and modeled the user profile api. I had no real trouble adding Firebase support, but the testing of the user profile api was more challenging than expected, since mocking Firebase was really impractical. After changes made by Alexandre, mocking was really made more practical and I had no more trouble finishing my task.

## Chau Ying Kot

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.

## Alexandre Piveteau (Scrum master)

My main duty for this sprint was to make sure the team collaborated smoothly, so I spent a considerable amount of time coordinating the different contributions and providing some inputs on using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Overall, I think this went well, as everyone did their part and we were able to ship the features we had planned. I also implemented navigation throughout the app, styling and theming, a Firestore in-memory store which we use for mocking, and helped implementing a bunch of screens and tests or the Firestore document layout for profiles. My time estimates were good, but they didn't account for the time spent coordinating the team work or helping my teammates.
