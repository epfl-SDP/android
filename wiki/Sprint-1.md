# Sprint 1

## Lars Barmettler

My task for this sprint is simple, but it's good to learn how to use `Compose` and `Kotlin`. I had no particular problems with the tasks itself but with the material. My laptop is slow when Android Studio is open, from now on, I will work on my PC at home.

For this sprint, I implemented the authentication screen's design and user interface to have it resemble its Figma prototype. I also added an animation to switch from the user's login screen to the sign up one following the corresponding button click. 
I experienced some issues in the beginning as I was not sufficiently familiar with Jetpack Compose or Kotlin, so I had to go through some tutorials for that matter. I also wasted a bit of time trying to integrate a plugin I discovered that transforms Figma nodes to Jetpack Compose code as I initially thought it would be the best way to create an exact replica of the Figma mockup. However, it turned out to be too complex and not that accurate. I therefore received major help from Alexandre who enlightened me on several Jetpack Compose aspects when my initial UI implementation had some issues. 
My time estimates for my sprint tasks were large and a bit exceeded because of those issues but should be much lower for the next one. I now have a stronger Kotlin and Jetpack Compose base but will try to strengthen it even more by watching more tutorials before the next sprint to be prepared for it.
