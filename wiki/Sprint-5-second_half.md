# Sprint 5 (first half)

## Lars Barmettler
This week I progressed slower than I’d liked to. Next to the SDP project we had multiple submissions in other courses and one midterm. Sadly, I had no time over the vacation week to work on the project, since I barely had access to a computer. However, I manged to do a big chunk of the edit profile task. This one is separated in two subtask the edit profile name (which I finished) and the edit profile image. For the edit profile image task, I’m in the middle of the development and will finish in the span of the next week. The teamwork was good, and I had not that many problems with merge conflict since the work was nicely isolated, from all other ongoing tasks.

## Matthieu Burguburu (Scrum master)
In addition to my scrum master task, I continued working on the puzzles feature. However, it went slower than expected for a few reasons. 
Firstly, the workload from other courses this week was quite high.
Secondly, the work needed to implement a puzzle prototype was higher than anticipated. In particular, a lot of the code needed would be duplicated from other components of the app. This would require a lot of refactoring after the fact, and I decided to take some more time to do it right the first time (hopefully). 

Except for the slower than usual speed, I would say the sprint went well.

## Chau Ying Kot
My planning for this second week of the sprint is a bit off. I had 1 midterm and 1 assignment. I only work on my 2nd task yesterday.  From what I have seen, the difficulty is to retrieve the new state of the board to be able to display it.

I will manage my time better next time.

## Fouad Mahmoud

## Alexandre Piveteau
In addition to what was done last week, I finalized the promotion UI and engine pull request by adding some extra unit and integration tests.

Moreover, I fixed a few low-hanging issues : I cleaned up some code, fixed a MVVM violation etc. I also gave a hand to some of my teammates.

The sprint went well and I finished all the tasks which I had been assigned.

## Mohamed Badr Taddist
This sprint went well in general. I was able to relax a bit from using jetpack and explore more powerful features of the Kotlin language. Annoyingly, I am still stuck by a test concerning the speech recognizer intents. I'll try to fix this with the help of the team members as soon as possible.
